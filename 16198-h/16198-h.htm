never perfectly well and happy unless she has
something the matter with her, especially if she
has nothing else to do; she's bored to-day, so
she's got a headache! To-night, when there's a
big ball to which she is not invited, she'll be frightfully
alarmed about herself for fear of appendicitis,
but to-morrow, when we have smart company at<!-- Page 43 -->
luncheon, she'll recover like a shot! It's all right
for Louise, but it's hard on my brother, who really
adores her.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She sits beside the table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> Adores! Say! That's the word I
want to use about you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> Nonsense, Sam! Do you know
anything about some stocks called United Copper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> Rotten! Don't touch it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> My brother had a tip this morning
on United Copper and wanted me to give him some
money to put in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> Listen! don't you do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> I wish you'd use your influence
with Steven to help him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> How?</p>
<!-- Page 44 -->
<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> You must know how mad he is
over speculation? But perhaps you don't know that
he has gone through all his own money, and, if
she'll let him, he'll go through his wife's next.
[<i>Smiling.</i>] Then I suppose it would be my turn!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> Why doesn't he keep out of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> He can't, we must keep it out of
him! Out of his blood!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> There's only one way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> Ruin him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> That's too anarchistic! You speculate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> But I always win!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> Can't you teach him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> Listen, if I could do that, I'd be the
richest man in the world before I got through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> Can't you give Steve a tip on some
<!-- Page 45 -->sure things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> There ain't any sure things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> Why, other friends of Steve are
always "putting him on to something good."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> And what happens?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> [<i>Smiling distressfully.</i>] Well, he
does lose, usually.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> I guess so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> But you must often have inside
information.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> And how much is that worth?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Takes up the false nose from table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> Well, it usually costs Steve all he
has! But I thought you&mdash;</p>

see this false nose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> [<i>Putting it on.</i>] Well, now what do I

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] I shouldn't like to
say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> Exactly! Well, see? That's what I'd
be if I believed in tips and "inside information."
If a man gives your brother a good tip, let him
drop it like hot lead. People with a real good tip
ain't giving it away. There's never enough to
divide up and go around,&mdash;not in this world,&mdash;and
inside information that gets told to a lamb
like your brother is too damned outside information
for me!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He rises and moves away, half in irritation, half

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> I started my dough with a mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] What's the use? he'll lose
everything just as quick in Wall Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> But I mean a good mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> [<i>Coming back to her.</i>] Listen! I worked

yet&mdash;don't have to now, but he likes it; he ain't
comfortable on top of the earth&mdash;says there's too
much room. If father'd been a man like Mackay,<!-- Page 48 -->
I guess he'd been just as rich as him to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> And still you won't help Steve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> T'ain't business. [<i>He puts back his
chair and leans toward</i> <span class="smcap">Georgiana,</span> <i>hand on table.</i>]
If helping him, mind you, would get you, I might

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> No, I like it! You must understand
this about my brother. [<i>Taking off the nose.</i>]
He is the dearest, best fellow in the world! kind-hearted
and wouldn't do a thing that wasn't straightforward
in business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> But you've got to be tricky if you want
<!-- Page 49 -->to succeed in our business. I don't mind telling you
right out between us, I'm tricky!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> I'm sorry to hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> Louise was a pretty good liar when she
was a kid. She ought to help her husband along
a little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> That's just it! if Steve had the
right sort of wife,&mdash;but all Louise wants is social
position and more money.</p>

He wanted to give me a ring of his mother's, but
I said "No," I wouldn't take that, it was sacred<!-- Page 101 -->

the girls was crazy about him. I met him to dancing
school Tuesday evenings at Adelphi Hall and
we started right in, every Sunday night to church
and every Saturday to the theatre. He enjoyed
Sundays best and I Saturdays, but I felt it was
because church was cheapest. He's dreadful
economical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> You get more attention than I

back row when there's fighting&mdash;and keep an eye
on his health. I'm afraid it's dreadful <i>damp</i>
being a soldier; and do you know that man
actually catches cold if he forgets his rubbers and
it sprinkles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> I don't think he ought to go if he's
so delicate; Mr. Coleman will take an interest in
your friend, I know, if I ask him. What's his
name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Mr. Gootch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> <i>Mr. Gootch!</i> Yes, I can remember
that. But, you see, if he's a soldier he must do
his duty, whatever it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> There's no holding him back! He's
jus' as likely as not to lose his position at Snipleys,
Crabford &amp; Snipleys, too, but he <i>will</i> go! It's

Well, I've got an elegant pair of scissors for mother,
marked down because of a flaw in the steel, but
she's near-sighted, and she don't want to use 'em anyway&mdash;it's
just to feel she has another pair. Scissors
is mother's fad&mdash;sort of born in her, I guess,
for my mother's mother was a kind of dressmaker.
She didn't have robes and mantucks over
her door, you know,&mdash;she was too swell for that,&mdash;she
went out by the day! And this is a real bronze
Louis ink-stand for my sister's husband, only <!-- Page 105 -->cost
thirty-nine cents and hasn't got a thing the matter
with it, so long as you don't see the others&mdash;if
you see the others, you'll observe that there's
a naked lady missing off the top part which I'm
glad of anyway as I'm giving it to a gentleman,
and he'll never see the others besides. And this is
two boxes of writing paper; aren't they <i>huge</i>!
<i>awful</i> cheap with a lovely picture of an actress
on top&mdash;Lillian Russell in <i>Mice and Men</i>, I think,
on one, and Jean Duresk the Opera Singer in
<i>Lonegrind</i> on the other. The boxes 'av got false
bottoms&mdash;so there ain't very much writing material,

You see they've got a whole counter of these beautifully
bound in red and gold, and only nineteen
cents. But it's so hard to decide which to buy.

it for <i>Lucille</i>. Which do you think my sister'd like
best, Homer's <i>Iliad</i> or <i>Lucille</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> I believe she'd prefer <i>Lucille</i>, and

<p><span class="smcap">Steven.</span> No, Georgy, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> For Steve's own sake, won't you do
something for him? Get him some position so that
he can take care of Louise. I'll look after myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> I'll do all and more, <i>if you'll</i> marry me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> You know I can't marry you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> What does Steve say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steven.</span> What Georgy says, I say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> How are you going to get out of this
<!-- Page 171 -->without me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steven.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> And there's something else. [<i>Steps
towards</i> <span class="smcap">Steven.</span>] Perhaps you don't know that
unless some one does get you out of this, it won't
be only a money smash-up for Georgiana, but disgrace
too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> That can't be true! I shall say
my brother had control of my money to do what
he liked with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> But any lawyer would take up the case
of criminal mismanagement for my aunt and
cousin's affairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> But <i>they</i> wouldn't allow it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> Well, what do you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steven.</span> Louise&mdash;never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> Leave it to me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steven.</span> Ah! your true colors! You heard
<!-- Page 172 -->him, Georgy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> Well, let that pass. But you know
that you've overdrawn at your bank, that you've
overdrawn at your brokers, and that you can no
more get out of the muddle you've got yourself
into without one of the biggest public scandals
there's been in the street for years!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> But <i>you</i> can spare us that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steven.</span> [<i>Very low.</i>] Good God!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He moves away.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> If you'll marry me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steven.</span> No! [<i>Comes down to her.</i>] Georgy,
you mustn't! [<span class="smcap">Coast</span> <i>walks away.</i>] Don't you
see what a selfish brute Sam is? Of course it<!-- Page 173 -->
was <i>my</i> fault that I gambled, but he tempted me,
he led me into it when he <i>knew</i> I <i>couldn't resist</i>.
The very day and hour I gave you my promise,
he gave me a tip and guaranteed I shouldn't lose!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> Sam! Oh!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She turns to the bench before her dressing table

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> [<i>Speaks to her across the table.</i>] It's
true! And I led him to speculate more, I tricked
him first with winning and then let him go! I
knew he'd soon do for himself alone, and he did!
Yes&mdash;I ruined him purposely and you through
him, so as to get you to be my wife. I did it
purposely and I'd do it again! Of course I meant
all along to make it up in the end when I'd got you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> And did you really think you
<i>could</i> get me that way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coast.</span> Why, you've got to marry me. You
<!-- Page 174 -->needn't be afraid of what I won't do for you. I
love you, you know that. Everything&mdash;I've
told you that before. You shall have <i>everything</i>
on God's earth you want, and Louise and her mother
shall live in style as they always have, and Steve
have his own money back, with a brother-in-law

it makes men of beasts. It doesn't take all for
itself&mdash;it sacrifices all for another. Love isn't
an enemy that lays traps and makes ambushes,&mdash;love
is a friend whose heart is a divine magnet!

a man, but love such as you have&mdash;oh, the happiness

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> I just bought one and it's got an article
about the 91st regiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steven.</span> What about it?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Looks to see if door is closed.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> [<i>Same voice.</i>] They say it may 'a' been
wiped out of existence: it's three weeks now since
news of it was due, and the paper's afraid they've
met with an ambyscade or something like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steven.</span> Oh, when the newspapers are hard
up for news they get up something about the
Philippines! It's the modern sea-serpent. When
there's absolutely nothing else to print&mdash;no girl
suicide in Brooklyn, or cyclone in Kansas, or jok<!-- Page 202 -->e
on Chicago, then they give the Philippines a paragraph
or an insurrection. Don't you worry, Miss
Shindle.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He sits in the arm-chair near the sofa.</i></p>

was the heathenest of the lot, and that there's
no good reason why if they'd hadn't no fight with
the natives, we shouldn't 'a' had news from them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steven.</span> The whole question of news in a case
like this is too uncertain to make so much alarm
about. The men's idea is not to send picture postal
cards of daily movements home to America,
but to lick the natives into shape!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> I'm sure you do comfort me. Don't
know as Miss Georgiana told you, but my young
man's out there, with Mr.&mdash;Lieutenant Coleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steven.</span> Well, don't worry. You just make up
<!-- Page 203 -->your mind the papers are short of news to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Goodness, they won't be to-morrow
with all they're going to print about this ball!
Say, I've a friend whose sister's a literary lady and
writes for the Sunday papers in Buffalo. She's
got an article in my line, called the "Heads of the
Smart Set which was Set at the Grand Duke."
Ain't that a cute name for an article? And it don't
mean their heads either; it means their coffyures,
as she says&mdash;she speaks French. She was born
and raised in Niagara Falls, near to Canada, where
the language comes natural,&mdash;over the water, as it
were!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steven.</span> [<i>Going to her.</i>] I wouldn't mention
this newspaper report to Miss Carley&mdash;it would
only needlessly alarm her, perhaps, and spoil her
evening.</p>

trusting hair. But besides, Mr. Coleman wasn't
a floor walker in a shop with over a hundred lady

flightier; and he being <i>bald</i>, has me to a disadvantage,

what continues to make me nervous about Mr.
Gootch is that he's right there among all those

was fine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> No, Bella, Henry Irving has never
been in this room, and it's Louis XVI.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> Oh, of course! [<i>Writing.</i>] How well
you're looking, Miss Georgiana. Look to me

piece, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgiana.</span> Does Mr. Gootch ever speak of
Mr. Coleman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> He worships him&mdash;naturally, as Mr.
Coleman got wounded in both arms carrying him
to a safe place! Mr. Gootch says as there wasn't

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
